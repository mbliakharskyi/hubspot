 * DISCLAIMER:
 * This is an example connector, the function has a poor implementation. When requesting against API endpoint we might prefer
 * to valid the response data received using zod than unsafely assign types to it.
 * This might not fit your usecase if you are using a SDK to connect to the Saas.
 * These file illustrate potential scenarios and methodologies relevant for SaaS integration.
